Version 1.0

Puff plants are desert-loving plants. They need a hot dry environment to survive.
They love places like the Ettin Desert, the Daedalus desert*, and Betaship.
They each grow a white fluffy ball which creatures love playing with.
Careful though, at any moment the ball may POP into countless drifting seeds.

*At least Daedalus version 1.2
Previous versions' desert was too wet.
